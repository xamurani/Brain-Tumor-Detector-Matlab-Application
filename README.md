# Brain Tumor Detector - MATLAB Application

Welcome to the **Brain Tumor Detector** repository! This project is a MATLAB-based application designed to detect brain tumors using advanced image processing techniques. It aims to assist medical professionals and researchers in identifying brain abnormalities efficiently and accurately.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Noise removal, contrast enhancement, and normalization.
- **Tumor Segmentation**: Identifies the tumor region in brain MRI images using advanced algorithms.
- **Visualization**: Displays the original and processed images for better analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple GUI to upload images and view results.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust settings for image processing based on user needs.

## Installation

To run this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xamurani/Brain-Tumor-Detector-Matlab-Application.git

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned directory.


3. Run the main script to launch the application.



Requirements

MATLAB: R2021b or later (earlier versions may work with slight modifications).
